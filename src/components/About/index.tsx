        Hello, I'm Angel Marenco, a full stack developer with two years of
        experience. I specialize in ReactJS, NextJS, and TypeScript and enjoy
        creating and maintaining web applications. When I'm not working, I enjoy
        constantly improving my skills. In my free time, I'm happy to share my
        expertise in both areas to help others. In the future, I plan to
        continue expanding my programming knowledge.
